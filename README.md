# UniGeo: Taming Video Diffusion for Unified Consistent Geometry Estimation

We propose UniGeo to jointly estimate geometric propertiesâ€”such as surface normals and coordinates-from
either multi-view images or video sequences within a unified space, by leveraging the inter-frame correspondence prior embedded in the video diffusion model.
